The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when using multiple units or complex calculations. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` might not work as intended if the parent container's width is not explicitly defined or contains other elements influencing its width.  Another common issue is the incorrect use of spaces within the `calc()` function.  Spaces are required around the operators (+, -, *, /).
